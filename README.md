# Oscar Muñoz

My name is Oscar Javier Muñoz Marciales, I am a systems engineer, a web developer for 5 years and a bilingual (spanish/english) speaker;  
I have worked in five different companies, and currently I am working in a full time job for the second largest construction company from Colombia, 
called Marval S.A., and the other one for an ecommerce development company from Spain named Unifema S.L.  
In my full time job I work in data integrations between different sources and in my part-time job I work as a web developer for creating/supporting different online stores. 


My working experience consist mainly in the languages/technologies PHP (Laravel/Symfony), Javascript (jQuery, Vanilla Javascript and Vue js), MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server, CSS (Bootstrap, BootstrapVue and Vuetify), and I try to improve everyday as much as I can as a professional web developer.  I have been part of many projects and have faced a lot of challenges related to them, and always I have successfully finished all those obstacles.
