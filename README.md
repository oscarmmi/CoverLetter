# Oscar Muñoz

My name is Oscar Javier Muñoz Marciales, I am a systems engineer, a web developer for 5 years and a bilingual (spanish/english) speaker;  
I have worked in five different companies, and currently I am working in a full time job for the second largest construction company from Colombia, 
called [Marval S.A.](https://marval.com.co/), and the other one for an ecommerce development company from Spain named [Unifema S.L](https://grupounifema.com/).  
In my full time job I work in data integrations between different sources and in my part-time job I work as a web developer for creating/supporting different online stores. 


My working experience consist mainly in the languages/technologies [PHP](https://www.php.net/) ([Laravel](https://laravel.com/)/[Symfony](https://symfony.com/)), [Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) ([jQuery](https://jquery.com/), [Vanilla Javascript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) and [Vue js](https://vuejs.org/)), [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/), [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads), [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS) ([Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), [BootstrapVue](https://bootstrap-vue.org/) and [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/)), and I try to improve everyday as much as I can as a professional web developer.  I have been part of many projects and have faced a lot of challenges related to them, and always I have successfully finished all those obstacles.
